# Speed the Speedrunners!
 
Speedrunning is when an individual attempts to **beat part or all of a video game as quickly as possible**. This can include individual levels, specific objectives, or unique limitations as decided by the community or player.
Speedrunning is a social activity, where on-line communities gather around [some particular games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_notable_for_speedrunning) and improve, compete and have fun around the idea of beating marks. 

## Speedrunning communities and motivation

There are large communities of speedruners, moderators and fans. The site [Speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/) has hundreds of thousands of registered users. Today these communities organize in sites as Speedrun.com that help shape interaction and competition, and are open to anybody. 

A key component of starting speedrunning is **motivation**, and in most of the cases speedrunners, moderators and fans gather together because they are passionate about a particular game, or they have incentives to show and share their skills with peers. 

## Crypto-incentives and communities

Here comes the idea of incentivizing speedrunners (and indirectly other community members as moderators) by using cryptoeconomics. 

A basic workflow for such an incentive system may at a very high level look like this:

* Anyone would be able to deposit some token or crypto to motivate speedrunners to beat some mark or objective, maybe expiring at some point in the future. 
* When an speedrunner hits and objective, an automated reward is delivered, via smart contracts. 
* However, not all the reward is delivered to the speedrunner, but some is retained for the community, which then can be used to incentivize other actors, or even failed runners. 

These overall ideas are just a blueprint for development for speedrunning communities that may eventually end up in these communities self-organizing as a DAO. So the next immediate step is prototyping the idea with a concrete simple workflow. 

### The Oracle problem
The main problem we face is that of checking when some speedrunners has effectively attained an incentivized objective. For now, we will resort to hybrid smart contracts that rely on a centralized source as speedrun.com. 

However, the process of getting sppedrun info on-chain from those kind of sites can be done inside a network of decentralized oracles, as [ChainLink](https://docs.chain.link/docs/request-and-receive-data/) that is able to get data from any API as that [provided by Speedrun](https://github.com/speedruncomorg/api). 


## Forward looking: decentralized speedrunning

We can imagine a future in which speedruning communities move to decentralization. This however will require overcoming a number of challenges, beyond those mentioned above. 

Ideally, the checking and measurement of speedruns could be done in a trustless way so that times and proofs of speedrun records can be attested in the blockchain witouth the need of sites as speedrun.com becoming an intermmediate stage.
